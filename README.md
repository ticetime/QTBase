**QTBase** is an "extraction" of [**TD Base**](https://github.com/ticetime/eliot-tdbase).

TD Base was designed to be used in K12 french schools in a complex technological and organisational context (very strong dependencies on all the components of the Information System) .
QTBase is more designed to work in Higher Education. All the dependencies on the  K12 french system are being removed from QTBase to make it a lighter application.
QTBase aims to support some experiments on Intelligent Tutoring System made at the [University Toulouse III](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/).
